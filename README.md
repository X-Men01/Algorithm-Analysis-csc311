# Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of Algorithms

This repository is part of the CSC 311 course, focusing on analyzing and comparing string-search algorithms: **Brute Force**, **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**, and **Boyer-Moore**.



## Overview

This project provides a foundational understanding of string-search algorithms for pattern matching, crucial in various applications in computer science. It includes:
- **Brute Force Algorithm**: A straightforward pattern-matching technique.
- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: An optimized search algorithm that leverages partial match data.
- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**: A highly efficient algorithm using heuristics to skip sections of text for faster matching.

The project is structured for educational purposes, with theoretical explanations and empirical analyses.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Brute Force Algorithm
Explores pattern matching by checking each possible position in the text.

### 2. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
Uses the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array to optimize the search.

### 3. Boyer-Moore Algorithm
Leverages bad character and good suffix heuristics to improve search efficiency, making it one of the fastest pattern-matching algorithms in practice.
